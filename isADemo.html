<h1>Natural Inheritance</h1>
<p>Most of the time when programmers talk about inheritance, they're refering to classical 
inheritance. Classical inheritance is what we're all familiar with, and it's fairly easy to 
understand. We're so used to it in fact, that we think nothing of the cludges that we use to
force our natural mode of thinking into a classification model. Natural Inheritance is a 
JavaScript implementation of the way our minds naturally organize concepts.</p>

<h2>Classical Inheritance</h2>
<p>The "classical" in "classical inheritance" is a bit of a double entendre. We mean both 
"the conventional (classical) type of inheritance" and "inheritance that relies on the classification"
of instances. This works fine for abstract concepts like "a Dog is an Animal" and "a Newspaper is a Publication",
but cracks start to show the closer we get to concrete instances of a thing. For example, consider these 5 
concepts<sup><a href="#footnote1">[1]</a></sup> in your mind:</p>
<ol>
 <li>a Publication</li>
 <li>a Newspaper</li>
 <li>The New York Times</li>
 <li>The May 15th Edition of the New York Times</li>
 <li>The 5/15 New York Times being used as kindling in my fire pit.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each concept is distinct in our minds, but is also an extension of the previous concepts. 
How would we model these 5 concepts using classical inheritance?</p>
<pre>
// start with a general Publication class
var Publication = Class.extend({ 
    initialize: function() { /* doSomethingIfThisWasntJustAnExample */ },
    getName: function() { return this.named; } 
});
// a Newspaper is an extension of the Publication concept
var Newspaper = Class.extend(Publication,{ 
    init: function() {        
        this._super.apply(this,arguments);
    },
    getCity: function() { return this.locatedIn; } 
});
// The New York Times is an instance of a Newspaper, so far, so good
var NYT = new Newspaper({ named: "The New York Times", locatedIn: "New York City" });
// The May 15th NYT is an instance of The New York Times... er, now what?
// I suppose we need another class...
var DailyPaper = Class.extend({ // TODO should this extend Publication, Newspaper, or nothing? 
  getNewspaper: function() {
    return this.newspaper;
  },
  getPublicationDate: function() {
    return this.publishedOn;
  }
}); 
// there we go, now we can model this safely
var May_15_NYT = new DailyPaper({ newspaper: NYT, publishedOn: new Date("2009/05/15") });
// a few days later the May 15th NYT is used for kindling... How do we model that?
var LocationStatusAwareObject = Class.extend({
    getObject: function() { return this.object; },
    getLocation: function() { return this.location; },
    getStatus: function() { return this.status; }
});
var kindling = new LocationStatusAwareObject({
    object: May_15_NYT,
    location: "my firepit",
    status: "smoldering"
});
</pre>
<p>So the fruits of applying classical inheritance to everything are readily apparent. 
We have 2 extra classes that maybe should or maybe shouldn't be somewhere in our class 
hierarchy, and don't really match any of our five concepts directly. Also, if I want to know
the name of the paper being used for my kindling, I now have 2 layers of indirection to wade
through: <code>kindling.getObject().getNewspaper().getName()</code></p>
<p><strong>*ahem*</strong> Surely there must be a more <em>natural</em> way to model these relationships!</p>

<h2>Natural Inheritance</h2>
<p>That's my cue to introduce the library, and by library I mean single<sup><a href="#footnote2">[2]</a></sup> 
public function:</p>
<pre>function isA(classOrObject,[methodsAndProperties]) { ... }</pre>
<p><code>isA</code> is used wherever you have one concept that is a more specific version of 
another. Whether that concept is implemented as a class or an object isn't important to <code>isA</code>.
Let's see how we can express our five concepts now.</p>
<noscript>Looks like you have JavaScript turned off (or NoScript). To keep things dry, the code snippets 
below are copied from the actual JS source, so you'll either need to turn JS on or view the page source.</noscript>
<pre id="Publication-Newspaper"> </pre>
<p>Our Publication class is more or less the same, as is the Newspaper class. We can continute to 
<code>isA(Newspaper,..)</code> and such to create whatever class hierarchy we want, but eventually we 
will need to create an instance of one of these classes.</p>
<pre id="NYT"> </pre>
<p>Here we witness the founding of The New York Times. Since <code>new Newspaper</code>
is an object, <code>isA</code> returns an object.</p>
<pre id="may_15_NYT"> </pre>
<p>Now the May 15th Times is published. If you examine the resulting Newspaper, you will see that it is named 
(<code>may_15_NYT.named</code>) "The New York Times" and was published on May 15th 
(<code>may_15_NYT.published</code>). We can rename it without changing the name of the paper in general, 
as stored in <code>NYT</code>. e.g.,</p>
<pre>may_15_NYT.named = "The New York Tymes";
// NYT.named === "The New York Times"</pre>
<p>I personally always change the i to a y in "Times" for that old tymey feel.</p>

<p>A few days later, we have no use for the paper and it takes on the new concept of kindling:</p>
<pre id="kindling"> </pre>

<h2>Applications</h2>

<p>I'll be the first to admit that natural inheritance can be scary. We're very comfortable with 
the world of classes and at first glance a few ugly hack classes seem "safer" than this objects
inheriting from objects voodoo. But there are some common problems that natural inheritance is 
<em>naturally</em> suited to.</p>

<h3>Revision History</h3>

<p>Suppose you have an object that the user can edit, say a document. You want to offer a history, 
so the user can see previous revisions and revert to one at anytime. A classical programmer is 
reading this and already thinking of how to implement the Revision class, maybe with specialized 
Change classes for each of the different types of edits that can be made. However, natural inheritance
makes this problem almost trivial:</p>
<pre>var history = {
  revisions: [],
  current: new MyObject(),
  save: function() {
    revisions.push(this.current);
    this.current = isA(this.current);
  },
  revert: function(revisionNumber) {
    this.current = isA(this.revisions[revisionNumber]);
  }
};</pre>
<p><code>current</code> is always the working copy. <code>revisions</code> has an object for each
version of the object for which save was called. </p>
